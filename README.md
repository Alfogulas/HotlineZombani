Pygame top-down template

This is a full version of basic game code utalising Pygame. It includes a database, mwnu/buttons, several enemy and player classes, a shop and points system as well as a functional version of the game written up as code. Feel free to use this as a baseline for any projects you might have.
A settings file is also included to make quick changes to any of the static global variables such as speed, player health, etc.
